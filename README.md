# FlowTask Landing Page

A modern, responsive SaaS landing page for FlowTask built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

**FlowTask Landing Page - Built with Vercel v0**

1. **Hero Section** - Responsive landing hero with centered text (heading, subheading, CTA button) on mobile that aligns left on desktop. Includes an optimized task management dashboard image that scales appropriately across all devices without overlapping the button.
2. **Features Section** - Three feature cards (Smart Task Tracking, Real-time Collaboration, Team Workspace) with icon-based design, responsive grid layout that stacks on mobile and displays 3 columns on desktop.
3. **Testimonials Section** - Five customer testimonial cards with 5-star ratings, customer names, and roles. Responsive grid layout with proper spacing and typography hierarchy for credibility building.
4. **Pricing Section** - Three-tier pricing cards (Free, Pro with recommended badge, Enterprise) with consistent widths, feature lists, and centered CTA buttons. Compact design with optimized spacing to eliminate whitespace.
5. **Footer** - Multi-column footer with navigation links, social icons, copyright notice, and proper semantic HTML structure. Fully responsive and accessible.
6. **Design System** - Custom color palette (primary blue, neutral grays), semantic design tokens in globals.css, responsive typography (2 font families), and Tailwind CSS v4 for all styling. Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints (sm, md, lg) for complete device responsiveness.
